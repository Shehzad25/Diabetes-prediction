🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting whether a person is diabetic or not using machine learning techniques based on medical diagnostic data. The model is trained on structured health data and performs binary classification.

📌 Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions worldwide. Early detection can help in effective treatment and lifestyle changes.
This project uses a supervised machine learning approach to predict diabetes based on several health parameters.
